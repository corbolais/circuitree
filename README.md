Merry Christmas!  This is a fun little Christmas decoration that I created as a gift to friends and family: a small circuit board in the shape of a Christmas tree, with flashing lights and decorative buttons, and a stand with has an optional nameplate.

I designed and programmed this from scratch for my closest friends and family.  It’s taken me several months of engineering, but it’s been a lot of fun, and I learned a lot of new things while I built it.  The engineering is all my own work; that’s why my name is in the copyright notice in one corner of the back!  It’s conceptually inspired by a similar circuit that Dad and I built in the 80s from a magazine article, but this circuit uses completely different modern technology.  I sent my blueprints to a factory in Houston to create the circuit boards, and to a one-man 3D printing company in Mountain View to create the stands.  I hand-programmed and signed each circuit board.  In the four months I spent creating this, I went through three revisions of the circuit board (plus several smaller test designs), four revisions of the stand, and hundreds of revisions of the program.  I hope you enjoy the Christmas lights in your home as much as I’ve enjoyed creating it!

The entire project is open-source; you're encouraged to modify and improve it.  Many of my friends are makers, so I want to make sure that they can have extra fun by reading the details.  The project is controlled by an ATtiny84A, so you can edit and change the code right in the Arduino IDE!  The firmware, debugging device, schematics, PCB design, and artwork is all in GitHub.

If you just want to look at the schematics and don't have KiCAD, you can go to the "releases" tab in GitHub and download a zip file with PDFs of the schematic and PCB, Gerber files for the PCB, .hex files for the firmware, and .stl and .png files of the stand.

For technical documentation, visit the wiki.  There are notes there about design decisions I've made, how to reprogram the Christmas tree, and other useful information for makers.
