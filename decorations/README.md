These are the original SVGs I used to create the decorative artwork on
the PCB.  This includes elements such as the snowflakes, wreath, etc.

Most of the decorations were created as svgs, exported as pngs,
imported to KiCad as mods, and then hand-edited to adjust layers.  I
haven't documented this process yet; please open an issue on GitHub if
you need information on how I did this.

My signature was not silkscreened; I hand-signed each board using a
Sharpie silver paint pen (34968PP).  The area of the PCB I signed was
deliberately cleared of vias (the only gaps in the silkscreen on the
back), so that the paint wouldn't conduct inadvertently.  My own
testing with the paint indicated that it's not conductive, but I still
wanted to avoid possible long-term corrosion or other issues.
