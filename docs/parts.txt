NEW PLAN:
MCU:
  > ATtiny85: 8-pin PDIP or SOIC, in https://github.com/damellis/attiny,
      hardware I2C, 0.5uA @ power-down
PMIC: charger, LDO, and EN pin
  > TPS65721 looks good but no BOB, QFN32
  STNS01 is ok but only 100mA LDO, annoying EN pin
  BQ24253 ok but confusing
  Adafruit passthru charger is MCP73833, no good regulated output
  M40 Express uses MCP73831 + regulator etc
Cap sensor w/ I2C and sleep mode
  Adafruit BOBs:
    AT42QT1010: Single channel
    AT42QT1012: Single channel w/ timeout
    MPR121: QFN32 12-channel
    AT42QT1070: SOIC 7-channel no sleep interrupt
  > CAP1188: QFN24, 8-channel + 8-LED, I2C, 50uA standby
  Sparkfun BOBs:
    AT42QT1011: Single channel
LED driver:
  Sparkfun BOBs:
    LP55231 http://sfe.io/p13884 QFN24 programmable I2C variable current
  > TLC5940 16-channel but uses shift register

TLC5940 16-channel but uses shift register
Package can dissipate 2.8W of heat at 25C without thermal pad
soldered; our designs only require it to dissipate < 1.5W which it can
do at nearly 85C without thermal pad.  (We use a thermal pad, but 1oz
Cu instead of the spec'd 2oz.)
