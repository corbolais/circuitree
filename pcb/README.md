# PCB files

These are the files for the electrical schematic and PCB.

These files are in KiCAD format.  If you check out this directory, you
should be able to open christmas-tree.pro in KiCAD to see the
schematic and PCB layout.

The decorative artwork (and a few custom footprints) are included in
the christmas-tree.pretty directory.  The original SVG files used to
produce the decorative artwork are in the GitHub repository in the
decorations subdirectory.

If you just want to view the schematics or PCB layout files, they are
available in PDF format in the [release
ZIP](https://github.com/piquan/christmas-tree/releases/download/r4.0/Christmas-Tree-r4.zip).

The bill of materials is not included in my KiCAD files.  The BOM I
actually used is
[in the wiki](https://github.com/piquan/christmas-tree/wiki/Bill-of-materials).
That wiki page also includes a few notes about why I chose particular
components, but I don't yet have full documentation about the
components' design constraints.
