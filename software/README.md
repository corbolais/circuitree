# Firmware to program and control the Christmas tree circuit

This contains two programs: the christmas-tree subdirectory contains
the actual firmware to be uploaded to the tree; it also contains a
script to upload the firmware and program the fuses.  The spi-slave
subdirectory contains a program used to read the serial debugging I/O
(see the wiki for more details).
