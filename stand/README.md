# Stand

The stand included with this project is 3d-printed, and designed in
OpenSCAD.

Many recipients have households with a common family name; for these,
the stand has a nameplate.  The stands I gave to some recipients (such
as families with children from a previous marriage) do not have
nameplates.  These are all generated from a common OpenSCAD file.
